## Archery Game 

This repository contains a simple archery game written in Python. The game simulates a classic challenge where you test your skills by shooting arrows at an enemy peeking over a castle wall.

### Features

* Random enemy positions
* User input for aiming your shot
* Scorekeeping for successful hits
* Optional time limit for user input (configurable)

### How to Play

1. Clone this repository or download the files.
2. Install any required libraries (currently none).
3. Run the game using `python main.py` (or your preferred Python interpreter).
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to shoot at the enemy.
5. Aim for the correct position and hit the Enter key within the time limit (if enabled).

### Code Structure

The code is organized into several functions for better readability:

* `generate_enemy_position`: Generates a random number representing the enemy's location.
* `display_row`: Creates a string with dots and an "O" at the enemy's position.
* `get_user_input`: Gets user input for aiming, handles invalid input, and allows quitting. (Optional timeout functionality included)
* `main`: Runs the main game loop, displaying the target, getting user input, and keeping score.

### How to Contribute

Feel free to fork this repository and make improvements! You can:

* Add new features like sound effects or visual enhancements.
* Adjust the difficulty level by changing the time limit or target display duration.
* Implement different enemy behaviors or scoring systems.
* Improve the code's readability or efficiency.
